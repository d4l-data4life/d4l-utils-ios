== Prerequisites

* XCode 12.5
* iOS 13.0
* Swift 5.4+
* Bundler
* AWS cli tool 

== Install

When done, run:

[source, bash]
----
bundle install

== Build

Just open XCode and build the Data4LifeSDKUtils Scheme.

== Release

A release branches of from `main` branch with following pattern:

* `release/{major}.{minor}.{patch})/prepare-{major}.{minor}.{patch}`

=== Steps

* Update link:CHANGELOG.adoc[CHANGELOG]
* Run prepare release script (eg. `bundle exec fastlane ios prepare_release version:"1.0.0" api_token:"xxxxxxx"`)
* On github, publish the release manually by setting the new tag (eg. `v1.0.0`)

NOTE: Prepare release script will fail if there is no new version defined in the changelog

=== Prepare release script steps 

The script executes the following commands:

* Update new versions in the README.adoc and project files (including badges)
* Do sanity checks (Proper version number in changelog etc.)
* Build framework and upload it to S3
* Update Package swift info (url and checksum)
* Commit and push changes (if prompted to do so)
* Create GitHub release draft with all of the information from link:CHANGELOG.adoc[CHANGELOG]

[source, bash]

bundle exec fastlane ios prepare_release version:"1.0.0" api_token:"xxxxxxx"

== Development Process

=== Features

Every change has to branch of from `main` and use this branch naming convention:

* `feature/{type_of_change}-{short_description}` or with ticket id `feature/{ticket_id}/{type_of_change}-{short_description}`

`main` must be always in releasable state.

==== Type Of Change

- *add* for new features or functionality
- *change* for changes in existing features or functionality
- *remove* | for removed features or functionality
- *fix* for any bug fixes
- *bump* for dependency updates
- *security* in case of vulnerabilities

Examples:

- `feature/SDK-456/add-awesome-hashing-algorithm`
- `feature/add-awesome-hashing-algorithm`
- `feature/remove-not-so-awesome-algorithm`
- `feature/fix-algorithm-corner-case`
- `feature/bump-lib-to-1.3.0`
